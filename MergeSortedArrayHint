1. This problem can be solved with two pointer, since both the arrays are sorted so the pointer should point to last element of each array.
2. Compare the elements at pointer index and add the bigger element at the last index of bigger array.
3. There can be a case when array 1 has no element, and other array has only one element, so comparision in this case would result in 
ArrayindexOutOfBound Exception. Handle this case.
