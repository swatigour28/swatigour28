  Loop through all of the competitions, and update the hash table at every
  iteration. For each competition, consider the name of the winning team; if the
  name already exists in the hash table, update that entry by adding 3 points to
  it. If the team name doesn't exist in the hash table, add a new entry in the
  hash table with the key as the team name and the value as 3 (since the team
  won its first competition). While looping through all of the competitions,
  keep track of the team with the highest score, and at the end of the
  algorithm, return the team with the highest score.
