1. The sorted input array may contain the set of negative numbers as well, 
so be mindful to add the squared output in the out array at correct location and not at the original index.

2. Try to optimize the solution by adding the squared elements at the correct location in the out array instead of soring the array later on.

3. The pointer can be maintained to figure out the lowest and the highest values and try putting elements from right to left.
